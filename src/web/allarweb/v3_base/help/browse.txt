<p>Any image that is desired for either download or ordering must be added to the
            shopping cart.  Images are added to the
			shopping cart by clicking the &quot;add to cart&quot; button beneath each image.</p>
<p>In order to find more detailed information for an image that is being 
            viewed, click on the image or the file name shown below
			the image.  A page providing detail image information will then 
			appear.</p>
<p>The maximum number of images that may be viewed on each page may be less then 
            the number found in your search.  If you have more images to view
			than are displayed, you will have a &quot;Next&quot; button available
			near the top of the screen which is used to view additional images
			from your search.  As you navigate ahead to view additional 
			pages of images, you will have a &quot;Previous&quot; button
			available to move back to image pages already viewed. You can also jump to each page using the numbered links next to the previous and next buttons.</p>

 <dt><b>JPEG</b>
    <dd><p>The Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) format is commonly used to display photographs and 
						other continuous-tone images in hypertext markup language (HTML) documents over the World Wide 
						Web and other online services. The JPEG format supports CMYK, RGB, and grayscale color modes, 
						and does not support alpha channels. Unlike the GIF format, JPEG retains all color information 
						in an RGB image but compresses file size by selectively discarding data.</p>
				<p>A JPEG image is automatically decompressed when opened. A higher level of compression results 
						in lower image quality, and a lower level of compression results in better image quality. In most 
						cases, the Maximum quality option produces a result indistinguishable from the original. Definition

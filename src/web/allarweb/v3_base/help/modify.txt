    <dt><a name='keymod'>Keyword Modification</a>
    <dd><p>Modify Keywords allows modifying one or more keywords for each product in the library.</p>
        <p>Keywords may be modified by either entering text in the text box that is to the
                        right of the keyword label, or using the drop down list box that is
                        found to the right of the text box.</p>  
        <p>Not all keyword options will have a drop down list box.  In addition, some text boxes used
                        for modifying keywords will already have an entry, while others 
                        are blank.</p>
        <p>Entering new keyword values in the blank text boxes, or
                        modifying existing text box values are both acceptable ways to modify the 
                        keyword.  The values in the drop down list boxes may also be used to select
                        keyword modifications.  If, for a given keyword, a new value is chosen from
                        the drop down list box, then another entry for that keyword is typed into
                        the text box, the text box value will be the one selected (regardless
                        of whether the text box entry is typed before or after the drop down list
                        box selection.)  For example, if
                        the &quot;File Type&quot; keyword has the value JPEG in the drop down list box, 
                        and the user selects EPS from the drop down list box, then the user types in 
                        EPSF in the blank text box, followed by pressing the &quot;Submit&quot; button,  
                        the value EPSF will be chosen.</p>
    <dt><a name='admin'>Why &quot;Online Library Administration&quot; page appears</a>
    <dd><p>In order to make changes to the keywords, the user must be logged into the Online Library
                        Aministration site.</p>  
        <p>After the first keyword modification(s) have been made
                        for a product, press the &quot;Submit&quot; button.  For the first keyword
                        update for a session, the &quot;Online Library Administration&quot;
                        site appears after pressing the submit button.  Log into the Administration
                        site using your administration user name and password (which should be the 
                        same as those used for entering the library that you are using.)</p>
        <p>After successfully logging into the Administration site, return to the library
                        by using the browsers &quot;Back&quot; key until you are back at the 
                        &quot;Modify Keywords&quot; page.  Then press the &quot;Submit&quot; again
                        to complete the keyword edit.</p>
        <p>Additional keyword edits may be made on other products in the library during the same
                        session.  The Adminsitration site only has to be entered once each 
                        session.</p>

    <dt><a name='return'>Return to &quot;Modify Keywords&quot;</a>
    <dd><p>After updating keyword(s) on a product, a blank web page will appear.  Return to the 
                        &quot;Modify Keywords&quot; page by using the browsers &quot;Back&quot; key                                                                                                                         until you are back at the desired page.</p>
    <dt><a name='reinit'>Always re-initialize after keyword edit session</a>
    <dd><p>Upon completion of a keyword modification session, it is very important to re-initialize
                        the Lazerweb system.  This is done through the 
                        &quot;Online Library Administration&quot; site.  Go to the
                        &quot;Libraries&quot; page, then click on the link 
                        &quot;Re-Initialize Lazerweb&quot;.  The re-initialization will
                        occur just by clicking on the link.</p>

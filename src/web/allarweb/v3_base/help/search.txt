<DIV ALIGN="center"><H2>Searching for Images</H2></DIV>

		<p>This is the page where you find the specific types of images you wish to view. You are 
		shown the total number of images matching your current search criteria and the search history 
		you have built up.</p>
		
		<p>At each screen you are presented with a category and new keywords to choose from in the 
		&quot;Category Drill-Down Search&quot;. If you already know your file name or a particular keyword 
		(eg. &quot;Wonderbra&quot;) you may enter that in the &quot;Keyword Search&quot; field.</p>
		
		<p>Once you have 
		narrowed your search criteria down to the point where 12 or fewer items match your search criteria, 
		you will be taken to the view images page. At any point you can view the images found in your 
		search by clicking the &quot;View&quot; tab at the top of the page.</p>

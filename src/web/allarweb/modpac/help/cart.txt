<p>The shopping cart 
            is your personal area in the Online Library. Elements are placed here 
            from search result pages. These elements will stay here for the 
            duration of your session. 
			<p>The element's thumbnail is a link to more information about it. 
            Select it to display a detail page.</p>
            <p>Each element in the page may have different check box options. 
            Possible options may include:</p>
    <ul>
            <li><a href='#dllo'>Download JPG (Powerpoint)</a>
            <li><a href='#dllo'>Download PDF (Email)</a>
            <li><a href='#ordhi'>Order CD-ROM (Accounts)</a>
            <li><a href='#remove'>Remove From Cart</a>
    </ul>
            <p>Select any desired actions for the elements by selecting the 
            appropriate check boxes under each element and then clicking on the 
            &quot;Proceed&quot; button. </p>

    <dt><a name='dllo'><b>Download</b></a>
    <dd><p>This option downloads a low-resolution version of this file. For more information on the files 
						that can be downloaded, see <a href="help.jsp?help=tips">Tips for Placing Orders</a>.</p>
    <dt><a name='ordhi'><b>Order</b></a>
    <dd><p>This option will bring up an order form for the elements chosen 
            for ordering.  This option is normally used to request a copy of the 
            HiRes version on some hard medium (such as a floppy or CD). For 
						more information, see <a href="help.jsp?help=tips">Tips for Placing Orders</a>.</p>
    <dt><a name='remove'><b>Remove From Cart</b></a>
    <dd><p>This option removes the element from your personal shopping 
            cart.  The file on the server is not affected.  The element remains in 
            the Online Library as a member of its database and as a member of any folders 
            it may be in.</p>
            <p>You can remove an element while also performing another action. 
            Removals are processed last, so the effect is to perform the other 
            action and then remove the element from your shopping cart.</p> 
            <p>If you remove something by accident, you can repeat your search to 
            find the element again and add it back to your shopping cart.</p>

<p>If you use an Apple Macintosh computer, any files you download from 
this site will be saved in an Aladdin Stuffit archive (.sit files). 
<p>This is a very common method for packaging and compressing files for 
speedy and safe transmission over the internet. Alladin's Stuffit format is so common, 
you probably have already have Stuffit Expander installed on your computer and may not even know it.
<p>If you do not have a copy of this free software or if you desire the latest version, go to the 
<a href="http://www.aladdinsys.com/expander/expander_mac_login.html" target="_blank">Aladdin's website</a> 
and download your copy. Installation is easy, you can even set up your browser to automatically decompress any 
.sit files you download.

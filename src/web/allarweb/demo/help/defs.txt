    <dd><p>The Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) format is commonly used to display photographs and 
						other continuous-tone images in hypertext markup language (HTML) documents over the World Wide 
						Web and other online services. The JPEG format supports CMYK, RGB, and grayscale color modes, 
						and does not support alpha channels. Unlike the GIF format, JPEG retains all color information 
						in an RGB image but compresses file size by selectively discarding data.</p>
				<p>A JPEG image is automatically decompressed when opened. A higher level of compression results 
						in lower image quality, and a lower level of compression results in better image quality. In most 
						cases, the Maximum quality option produces a result indistinguishable from the original. Definition

    <dd><p>The Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) language file format can contain both vector and bitmap graphics 
						and is supported by virtually all graphic, illustration, and page-layout programs. The EPS format 
						is used to transfer PostScript language artwork between applications. When you open an EPS file 
						containing vector graphics created in another application, Photoshop rasterizes the file, converting 
						the vector graphics to pixels.</p>
				<p>The EPS format supports Lab, CMYK, RGB, indexed-color, duotone, grayscale, and Bitmap color modes, 
						and does not support alpha channels. EPS does support clipping paths. Definition courtesy Adobe Systems Incorporated.</p>

    <dd><p>The Portable Document Format (PDF) is used by Adobe Acrobat, Adobe's electronic publishing software 
						for Windows, Mac OS, UNIX, and DOS. You can view PDF files using the Acrobat Reader software. Identical 
						to PostScript pages, PDF files can represent both vector and bitmap graphics, and can contain electronic 
						document search and navigation features such as electronic links. For more information on PDF and Adobe 
						Acrobat, see the Electronic Publishing Guide included on the Tour & Training CD-ROM. Definition courtesy

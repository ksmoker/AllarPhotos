<p>You may choose to search the library based on how new the files are. This is useful if
		you frequently visit the library and you would like to only see new additions. If this is 
		the case, use the &quot;Date Search&quot; option.</p> 
<p>You may choose to view files added to the library in the past day, the past week or the 
		past month. Simply choose the appropriate option in the drop-down menu provided.</p>
<p>The number of files matching your 
           search criteria will be shown at the top of the page. You may 
           either view the images at this point by clicking on the &quot;View Now&quot; 
					 menu option, or narrow your search further by either repeating 
           the Date Search procedure or by using the <a href="help.jsp?page_view=keyword_search">Keyword Search</a> 
					 or the <a href="help.jsp?page_view=category_search">Category Search</a> procedure. The 
					 &quot;View Now&quot; option is only 
					 available after you have narrowed your search to fewer than 100 files.</p>
        <p>As new categories in a category hierarchy are selected, they will be
           shown in the &quot;Common Elements&quot; block of the search panel.</p>
        <p>Note:  At any time you may click the 
           &quot;Reset Search&quot; menu item to restart your search.
           </p>

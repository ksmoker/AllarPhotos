    <dt><b>EPS</b>
    <dd><p>The Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) language file format can contain both vector and bitmap graphics 
						and is supported by virtually all graphic, illustration, and page-layout programs. The EPS format 
						is used to transfer PostScript language artwork between applications. When you open an EPS file 
						containing vector graphics created in another application, Photoshop rasterizes the file, converting 
						the vector graphics to pixels.</p>
				<p>The EPS format supports Lab, CMYK, RGB, indexed-color, duotone, grayscale, and Bitmap color modes, 
						and does not support alpha channels. EPS does support clipping paths. Definition courtesy Adobe Systems Incorporated.</p>
